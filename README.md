# Module-15: Data Structures in C
## Overview
This repository contains C programs that demonstrate fundamental operations on data structures such as binary trees, heaps, and expression trees. Each program is designed to illustrate specific algorithms and concepts in data structure manipulation.

## Contents
### construct_expression_tree.md:
Implements an algorithm to construct an expression tree from a postfix expression and converts it to an infix expression using in-order traversal.

### delete_an_element_from_binarytree.md:
Demonstrates the deletion of a specified element from a binary search tree (BST) and performs an in-order traversal to display the updated tree.

### deletion_of_element_in_heaptree.md:
Shows how to delete a specific element from a heap (max-heap or min-heap) and re-heapify the structure to maintain the heap property.

### seaching_in_binary_tree.md:
Provides a method to search for a particular element in a binary tree and indicates whether the element is found.

## Getting Started
##To compile and run the programs:

### Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Haripriya132006/Module-15.git
```
### Navigate to the repository directory:
```
cd Module-15
```
### Compile the desired C program using a C compiler, for example:
```
gcc delete_an_element_from_binarytree.c -o delete_node
```
### Run the compiled program:

```
./delete_node
```
Note: Replace delete_an_element_from_binarytree.c with the actual filename of the program you wish to compile and run.

## Usage
Each .md file contains the source code and explanations for the respective data structure operation. You can copy the code into a .c file, compile it using a C compiler, and execute it to observe the behavior of the data structure operations.
